## üöÄ Introduction

`typescript-mini-starter` is designed to be a robust and minimalistic starting point for TypeScript development, catering to the modern JavaScript ecosystem. This starter kit uniquely supports both ECMAScript Modules (ESM) and CommonJS (CJS) formats, ensuring compatibility and flexibility for various use cases and environments. Whether you are building a library, an application, or a service, this starter kit provides a quick and easy setup, enabling developers to jump straight into coding with TypeScript's best practices and the versatility of module systems in mind.

## üì¶ Install

Easily set up the project with the following command:

```sh
yarn install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies to get you started.

## üî® Usage

To compile your TypeScript code:

```sh
yarn build
```

This command will build your project, preparing it for execution or deployment.

## üåü Example

Run an example to see `typescript-mini-starter` in action:

```sh
yarn example
```

This is a great way to understand how the project works and can be extended.

## üß™ Run tests

Ensure the reliability of your code by running tests:

```sh
yarn test
```

This helps in maintaining code quality and catching bugs early.

## üöö Using `npx degit` to Scaffold Your Project

Easily scaffold a new TypeScript project with `typescript-mini-starter` using `npx degit`. This method is especially handy for integrating the starter into monorepos or initializing a standalone project quickly.

### For Standalone Projects

1. **Create a new project directory and navigate into it:**

   ```sh
   mkdir my-new-project
   cd my-new-project
   ```

2. **Use `degit` to download the mini-starter template:**

   ```sh
   npx degit jellydn/typescript-mini-starter
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and get started:**

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

### For Monorepos (e.g., with [Turbo](https://turbo.build/repo))

1. **Navigate to your monorepo's packages directory:**

   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/monorepo/packages
   ```

2. **Create a new package folder:**

   ```sh
   mkdir my-new-package
   cd my-new-package
   ```

3. **Download the mini-starter template into the new package:**

   ```sh
   npx degit jellydn/typescript-mini-starter
   ```

4. **Proceed with your monorepo's workflow to integrate the new package.**

This approach is efficient and reduces the time to set up a new TypeScript project, allowing you to focus more on development.
